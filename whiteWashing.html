                <p>Jenny Slate made headlines earlier this year when she relinquished the role of Missy on Netflix's Big Mouth, joining several other white actors in stepping down from playing animated characters of color.</p>

                <p>But at the same time, we had this character who Jenny was playing so beautifully, and in a way that was making a lot of people feel seen in a way that they hadn’t before, because Missy is such a unique biracial character.</p>

                <p>Partway through Big Mouth's just-released fourth season, fan-favorite Missy was given a new voice — that of comedian Ayo Edebiri, who had fallen in love with the character as a college student and was already part of the show's writers room.</p>

                <p>There’s something with Missy where there’s this nervous, endearing, cerebral energy that is very hard to fake. Like, it has to be real within you to play. And Ayo really had that from the beginning.</p>
