                <p>"Tone policing is the act of invalidating or derailing a call out/call in/discussion based on your reaction to the incident...</p>
 
                <p>Tone policing doesn't have to be race-related. But, in the wake of George Floyd's death last May and the summer's Black Lives Matter protests, tone policing in a racial context took center stage. Protests in cities across the U.S. were tainted by mainstream media's depctions of acts such as vandalism and arson as widespread.</p>

                <p>African Americans are disproportionately represented in news stories about poverty, and these stories tend to paint a picture that is particularly likely to reinforce stereotypes and make it hard to identify with black males.</p>
 
                <p>For example, low-income blacks in news stories are more likely to live in slums or urban areas, as opposed to rural areas, than real-world averages would suggest; more likely be entirely unemployed and “idle”; and so forth. The idle black male on the street corner is not the “true face” of poverty in America, but he is the dominant one in media portrayal. </p>
